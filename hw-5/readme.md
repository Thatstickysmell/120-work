## The Setup
The width and height of the canvas is the size of the window it is in. The background within the function draw(); loop, and as a result the person I created is only ever at one place on the screen. 

## Learning
- For this project, I learned the hard way that the order of operations is very important. I spent a lot of time rearranging the parts of the body because if it wasn't arranged correctly then the arms would not appear.
- Additionally, I figured out how to use variables, with assigned values, to avoid constantly using numbers to define parameters when placing objects.
