## Using loops
For this project, I learned how these lines of code worked by turning the functions into sentances. For example, when we use ` for (let x = 10; x <= width; x += 10) {}` I would turn into a sentance to understand it easier. I would say, "When x is 10, and x is less that the width of the screen, then the opperation below will happen, and every frame, x will increase by 10." This is how I started to understand how these loops worked. 

## Using `for`
Most of ther errors for this project were just forgetting to use `;` in the `for` code.
