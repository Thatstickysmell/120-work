## During this homework cycle I started using GitBash as my command center. I chose to use an option that allows for the use of some windows commands to work as well as Unix. A lot was learned from YouTube videos. I also started using Visual Studio Code as my text editor. I use GitHub desktop to push my work to GitHub.com

### These are the steps I took to complete this assignment:

1. Looked at many examples of how to use my GitBash command center. Mostly YouTube.
2. Explored how to create, edit, move, rename, and remove files. 
3. Downloaded Visual Code Studio as my text editor.
4. Downloaded GitHub Desktop and linked it to my GitHub account. 
Created a repo using my text editor and GitHub Desktop and pushed it to the GitHub website. 
5. Studied Markdown.

Problems I faced:

- I found out that using GitBash, you can't simply remove a whole directory with the `rm` command. I found others online using `rm -r` to delete whole directories. 
- Using the preview feature in Visual Studio Code is different than Atom's preview. I had to do some clicking around before I found my preview page.
- Adding a screenshot to my text editor preview area.

## So far, I have not discovered anything I would like to disscuss further. However, I'm sure I will find topics of interest and problems as I continue this course. 

## I am late to the game here so I haven't offered help to my peers yet. I hope soon to be helpful with what I learn and I hope others will offer a helping hand if it is needed!
