## The Setup
#### I began my sketch by creating a square background with a height and width of 500 pixels. Then I translated everything to the center. Using a square canvas seemed to be the easiest way to begin my sketch, because if every sketch I create begins from the center of the canvas, then I would only need to deal with numbers between 0 and 250 when I placed objects. 

## The Self Portrait
#### I found the push(); and pop(); codes were helpful for separating segments of the body. I used the push(); and pop(); tools to make sure every shape had the specific stroke weights and colors I was looking for. The order and arrangement of the body parts was the most difficult for me. It took me many tries to put the arrange the code properly.

## Resources
       Whenever something confusing turned up during my work, I would work with the live examples provided by p5js.org/reference/ and experiment with the code until I understood how the code worked. This week I also learned how to make the text box you are using now.
