## The Setup
         I began my sketch by creating a square background with a height and width of 500 pixels. Then I translated everything to the center. Using a square canvas seemed to be the easiest way to begin my sketch, because if every sketch I create begins from the center of the canvas, then I would only need to deal with numbers between 0 and 250 when I placed objects.  

## The Self Portrait
         I found the push(); and pop(); codes were helpful for sepparating segments of the body. I used the push(); and pop(); tools to make sure every shape had the spasific stroke weights and colors I was looking for.
