## Things I applied
I created objects with variables within them to help me remember the possitions of certain objects. 
I also learned how to generate random outcomes within functions. I used a random color generator in this project. I constrainded one of my moveavle objects so that you could not move the object off of the screen. 
For this project, I also learned how to make my random star generator contained around the screen.
