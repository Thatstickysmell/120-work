Zach Kessler week 3

["Hello World!"](https://thatstickysmell.github.io/120-work/HW-3/)

# This lesson, I really started to get a good grasp of the work flow.

 - I understand the chain of commands needed to provide my work on Github
 - It's becoming easier to remember where I put spaces, dashes, and other characters in this code.
 - I can now "visualize" in my head what is happening with my work. 

### I watched the instructional videos provided by Michael Musick and did not run into any problesm this lesson. I had to watch many of them a few times. Doing my work along with the videos is very helpful because there is a good chance that the work would take me much longer just reading along with the steps on the course website. However, those notes are stil very helpful as well. 

### I fell behind and didn't aid my peers for this lesson. I do feel I am learning a lot and I hope to help this class solve problems as a team. 

### I need to ask the class if they know how to center or justify text in Visual Code Studio. I looked for an answer online but I haven't found the right info. 

# Cool Thoughts!
- How do we create a canvas that fits the screen of whatever device we are using?

- Can a coding artist allow a user to experiance multiple, movable, resizable canvases? Why whould you want to do this? I'm not sure. I'll leave that to the real artists.
