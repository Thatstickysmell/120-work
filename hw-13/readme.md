## Final Project
### For my final project, I would like to make a musical score that shows a combination of notes being played together, represented by placement and color on the canvas. When certain combinations of notes are played together, there will be a key change. As a result, A different combination of keys will be represented.

## Procedure
### I plan on using modular arithmetic and probability in my code to determine what notes are going to be played, what notes are going to be played together, and when a different variety of notes starts to appear and be played.

## Goals
- Make the score look like it is moving from left to right using either colors and/or draw loops.
- Change the key of the score from the key of C to the key of C Sharp every time the notes "C" and "F" are played.
- I really hope to manage applying sound to each note as it is displayed.
