## Function Creation
#### I found creating functions to be rather easy. Simply, create the image or action you want to make,and create it as a function instead of an object stuck in a draw loop using `function someNewThing() {}`.

## Arrays
These were a bit more difficult to navigate around for me. before I found my hanging color solution of, `arr = ( arr + 1) % bgColor.length;` I was always stuck as to how to change the background color. I was putting this in the function itself at first instead of in the draw function. placement and organization are still some of the more difficult aspects of coding for me.
